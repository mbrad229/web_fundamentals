<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Dough (Make Ahead for Overnight Rise)</h4>

<div>
<ul class="croissantdoughingredients">
<li class="croissantdough">1 and 1/2 cups whole milk, heated to warm (105°F–110°F)</li>
<li class="croissantdough">1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
<li class="croissantdough">1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast (from two 1/4-oz packages)</li>
<li class="croissantdough">3 and 3/4 to 4 and 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
<li class="croissantdough">1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
<li class="croissantdough">3 sticks (1 and 1/2 cups) cold unsalted butter</li>
<li class="croissantdough">2 kitchen towels (not terry cloth)</li>
<li class="croissantdough">1 ruler</li>
<li class="croissantdough">1 pastry brush</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="croissantdoughprep">Dough Preparation</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Stir together warm milk, brown sugar, and yeast in bowl of standing mixer and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If it doesn’t foam, discard and start over.) Add 3 and 3/4 cups flour and salt and mix with dough hook at low speed until dough is smooth and very soft, about 7 minutes.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Transfer dough to a work surface and knead by hand 2 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, a little at a time, to make a soft, slightly sticky dough. Form dough into a roughly 1 1/2-inch-thick rectangle and chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, until cold, about 1 hour.</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>After dough has chilled, arrange sticks of butter horizontally, their sides touching, on a work surface. Pound butter with a rolling pin to soften slightly (butter should be malleable but still cold). Scrape butter into a block and put on a kitchen towel, then cover with other towel. Pound and roll out on both sides until butter forms a uniform 8- by 5-inch rectangle. Chill, wrapped in towels, while rolling out dough.</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Unwrap dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface, dusting with flour as necessary and lifting and stretching dough (especially in corners), into a 16- by 10-inch rectangle. Arrange dough with a short side nearest you. Put butter in center of dough so that long sides of butter are parallel to short sides of dough. Fold as you would a letter: bottom third of dough over butter, then top third down over dough. Brush off excess flour with pastry brush.</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Turn dough so a short side is nearest you, then flatten dough slightly by pressing down horizontally with rolling pin across dough at regular intervals, making uniform impressions. Roll out dough into a 15- by 10-inch rectangle, rolling just to but not over ends.</p>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Brush off any excess flour. Fold in thirds like a letter, as above, stretching corners to square off dough, forming a 10- by 5-inch rectangle. (You have completed the first "fold.") Chill, wrapped in plastic wrap, 1 hour.</p>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Make 3 more folds in same manner, chilling dough 1 hour after each fold, for a total of 4 folds. (If any butter oozes out while rolling, sprinkle with flour to prevent sticking.) Wrap dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill at least 8 hours but no more than 18 (after 18 hours, dough may not rise sufficiently when baked).</p>
<h3 id="croissantassembly">Assembly and Baking</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Cut dough in half and chill 1 half, wrapped in plastic wrap. Roll out other half on a lightly floured surface, dusting with flour as necessary and stretching corners to maintain shape, into a 16- by 12-inch rectangle. Brush off excess flour with pastry brush and trim edges with a pizza wheel or sharp knife.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Arrange dough with a short side nearest you. Cut in half horizontally and chill 1 half. Cut remaining half vertically into thirds, forming 3 rectangles. Cut each rectangle diagonally in half to make 2 triangles, for a total of 6 triangles.</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Holding short side (side opposite tip) of 1 triangle in one hand, stretch dough, tugging and sliding with other hand toward tip to elongate by about 50 percent.</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return to work surface with short side of triangle nearest you. Beginning with short side, roll up triangle toward tip. Croissant should overlap 3 times, with tip sticking out from underneath; you may need to stretch dough while rolling.)</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Put croissant, tip side down, on a parchment-lined large baking sheet. (Curve ends inward to make a crescent shape if desired.)</p>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Make more croissants with remaining 5 triangles, then with remaining rolled-out dough, arranging them 2 inches apart on baking sheet. Repeat rolling, cutting, and shaping procedures with chilled piece of dough.</p>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slide each baking sheet into a garbage bag, propping up top of bag with inverted glasses to keep it from touching croissants, and tuck open end under baking sheet.</p>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Let croissants rise until slightly puffy and spongy to the touch, 2 hours.</p>
<h4>Step 9</h4>
<p>Adjust oven racks to upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 425°F.</p>
<h4>Step 10</h4>
<p>Remove baking sheets from bags. Spritz inside oven generously with spray bottle and close door. Put croissants in oven, then spritz again before closing door. Reduce temperature to 400°F and bake 10 minutes without opening door.</p>
<h4>Step 11</h4>
<p>Switch position of sheets in oven and rotate sheets 180°, then reduce temperature to 375°F and bake until croissants are deep golden, about 10 minutes more.</p>
