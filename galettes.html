<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4>Dough</h4>
<div>
<ul class="galettedoughingredients">
<li class="galettedough">1 and 1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
<li class="galettedough">3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li class="galettedough">1 and 1/3 cups (180g) all-purpose flour, plus more for surface</li>
<li class="galettedough">3/4 cup (1 and 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Filling and Assembly*</h4>
<div>
<ul class="galettefillingassembly">
<li class="galettefilling">2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1 teaspoon finely grated lime zest</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1/3 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1 lb. peaches, cut into ¾"-thick wedges</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1 lb. plums, cut into ¾"-thick wedges</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1 teaspoon finely grated peeled ginger (optional)</li>
<li class="galettefilling">1 tablespoon heavy cream</li>
<li class="galettefilling">Softly whipped cream or vanilla ice cream (for serving; optional)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Whisk sugar, salt, and 1⅓ cups flour in a medium bowl. Cut butter into 6 rectangular pieces (if using ½-cup sticks, cut them in half crosswise, then in half again lengthwise). Toss butter in dry ingredients to coat, then dump mixture out onto a work surface. Most recipes start by pulverizing fat into small bits, but here you’ll use a rolling pin to flatten flour-coated butter into sheets that will puff into layers when baked.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Roll butter into flour until it is in long flexible strips, using a bench scraper to scrape butter off rolling pin or surface as needed.</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Use bench scraper to gather mixture into a loose pile, then drizzle 4 Tbsp. ice water over.</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Using your hands and the bench scraper, toss mixture until water is distributed, then gather into a rectangular pile.</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Roll out dough to a long rectangle with short ends about 8" wide, then use bench scraper to fold dough into thirds, like folding a letter. It will be very crumbly and loose; don’t panic. This turns the floury mass into a cohesive unit while creating flaky-making stacks of fat and flour.</p>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Using bench scraper to help, turn rectangle 90° and repeat rolling and folding, gathering loose bits of dough from outer edges into the center and flouring surface as needed.</p>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Repeat rolling and folding a third time. Dough should be somewhat homogenous and creamy-looking with some dry bits around edges. Squeeze a bit in your palm; it should loosely hold together. If not, repeat rolling and folding.</p>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Wrap folded dough in plastic, then press it into a compact disk about 1" thick. Chill 30 minutes.</p>
<h4>Step 9</h4>
<p>Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12"–14" round or oval about ⅛" thick (don’t worry about cracks around perimeter). Dust surface and rolling pin with flour as needed and rotate dough often to prevent wider cracks. If dough sticks to surface, lift on one side and scatter flour underneath before continuing. Roll dough onto your pin, then unfurl it on a sheet of parchment paper. Slide onto a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you prep the filling.</p>
<h4>Step 10</h4>
<p>Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling out.</p>
<h4>Step 11</h4>
<p>Preheat oven to 400°.Combine cornstarch, lime zest, salt, and ⅓ cup sugar in a medium bowl. Toss with your hands to combine, then add fruit and toss to coat. Add lime juice, vanilla, and ginger (if using); toss gently.</p>
<h4>Step 12</h4>
<p>Arrange fruit mixture in the center of chilled dough (still on parchment on baking sheet) and spread out evenly, leaving a 3" border. Fold edges of dough up and over fruit, pleating as needed and being careful that folded edge of dough doesn’t tear (if it does, patch with dough scraps and pinch to seal). Pour cream into a small bowl and brush all over dough. Sprinkle sugar evenly over dough.</p>
<h4>Step 13</h4>
<p>Place galette in oven and immediately reduce heat to 375°. Bake, rotating halfway through, until crust is deep golden brown everywhere, fruit is softened, and juices are bubbling, 45–50 minutes. Let galette cool 2 hours before serving.</p>
<h4>Step 14</h4>
<p>Serve galette with whipped cream or ice cream if desired.</p>
<h4>*For filling, I like to substitute with any fresh seasonal fruit, or whatever frozen fruit is in my freezer. As long as you include the cornstarch, salt, and a little sugar, you can play around with filling. One of my go-to's is a peach, lemon, ginger filling.</h4>
